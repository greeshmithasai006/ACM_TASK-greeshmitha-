I first used html codes to create basic portfolio and then added css styles to it. 
In this i used tables , links , lists , img src.
I made this portfolio responsive which means it will adjust its size by width of the screen.
I gave functionalities to my contact section which will open mail or instagram account or contact when you click on my contact details.
I used tables for my education details which will describe you about my place and year.
Id's are used to make css styles easy.
CSS styles i used for every page of my portfolio.
media query is used to make it responsive.
links hover is used to change colors of link when clicked.
